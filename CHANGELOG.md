version and are listed with a migration note.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-08-11

A correctness and hardening release. Four memory-safety bugs are fixed, a
type-checking gate was added that surfaced 68 latent compile errors across 22
modules, and the public API changed in several places as a result.

### Security

- **`Writer` performed no bounds checking.** Every write was a raw `@memcpy`
  into a fixed 4096/8192-byte buffer, and the `!void` return type never actually
  produced an error. In `ReleaseFast`/`ReleaseSmall` — the modes used to ship
  wasm — an oversized style silently wrote past the end of the buffer. Writes
  are now bounds-checked and truncate cleanly, reporting the first overflow.
- **JWT signature lengths were unchecked.** `verify` copied the decoded
  signature into a fixed-size array with `@memcpy` without comparing lengths.
  The decoded length is attacker-controlled, so a crafted token caused a panic
  under ReleaseSafe and a buffer overflow under ReleaseFast/ReleaseSmall. A
  wrong-length signature is now `error.InvalidSignature`.
- **The SSR path did not escape HTML.** Text nodes and attribute values were
  written into the served document verbatim, so any value containing markup
  became markup. Text and attributes are now escaped. `Vapor.Html(...)` and
  `Svg` remain raw by design — treat them like `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.

### Breaking changes

| Before | After | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `JWT.DecodingKey.fromEs256Bytes([N]u8)` | `fromEs256Sec1([]const u8)` | ECDSA public keys are SEC1-encoded and accept compressed or uncompressed forms; the old fixed-array signature could not express either |
| `JWT.DecodingKey.fromEs384Bytes([N]u8)` | `fromEs384Sec1([]const u8)` | as above |
| `DateTime.addDays(...) DateTime` | `addDays(...) !DateTime` | negative day counts can land before the epoch, which `fromTimestamp` rejects |
| `.gradient(types.Background)` | `.gradient(types.Color)` | `types.Background` no longer exists; the field it assigns is `?Color` |
| `.hoverBackground(types.Background)` | `.hoverBackground(types.Color)` | as above |
| `Draggable.element: Binded` | `element: *Binded` | `init` always took a pointer; the value field could never be constructed |
| `printUIRouteTree(u32)` | `printUIRouteTree([]const u8)` | routes are string paths everywhere else |
| `Writer.write(...) !void` | `... error{OutOfSpace}!void` | the old error set was empty, so `catch` branches were dead code that silently type-checked |

**Removed** — `.key()` on the component builders, along with `UINode.key`. It
assigned a field that nothing in the library ever read, so it silently did
nothing. `.id()` is the real keying mechanism: it writes the uuid directly, so
identity survives a move. Anything using `.key()` should use `.id()`.

Also removed — each of these referenced types, fields or functions that no
longer existed and could not compile if called:

- `Vapor.ThemeType`, `Vapor.SrcComponent` — dangling re-exports pointing at nothing
- `lib/helpers.zig` (`generateUUID`, `UUID`) — needed a time and entropy source
  that Zig 0.16 no longer provides ambiently on freestanding wasm
- `Element.removeFromParent` — called `Vapor.removeFromParent`, which never existed
- `Vapor.addRoute`, `Vapor.end` — superseded, and referencing removed APIs
- `UIContext.endContext`, `createStack`, `traverse`, `traverseChildren` — a dead
  `RenderCommand` tree layer calling allocator methods that no longer exist

**Behavioural notes:**

- `Writer.size` is now `buffer.len - 1`. The last byte is reserved so callers
  can always write their NUL terminator at `pos`; these buffers are handed to JS
  as C strings.
- `types.TextDecorationType` gained a `blink` member. Exhaustive switches over
  it need a new prong.
- `types.color_theme` is now `var`, not `const`. `switchColorTheme()` mutates
  it, which previously could not compile.

### Added

- **`zig build check`** — a type-checking gate. Zig analyses declarations
  lazily, so unreferenced code is parsed but never type-checked; this is how 68
  errors accumulated unnoticed across 22 modules. `src/check.zig` references
  every public declaration in every module, and `build.zig` fails if a new file
  under `src/` is not listed. Runs against `wasm32-wasi` and the host. Wired
  into both `zig build` and `zig build test`. Runs against three targets:
  `wasm32-wasi`, the host, and `x86_64-linux` explicitly, so a macOS developer
  sees what CI sees.
- `StringTable.handleOf` — look up an interned string's handle without
  interning it. Lets `Vapor.unpin([]const u8)` work.
- `Kit.Fetch` and `Kit.Response` — aliases into `Fetch.zig`, where the HTTP
  layer now lives.
- `Vapor.StateType` — re-export that `comptime.zig` already claimed to provide.
- MIT `LICENSE` file, which the README had referenced without it existing.
- Test suite grew from 28 to 51 tests, covering `Writer` bounds, JWT signature
  lengths, HTML escaping, the style compiler's truncation boundary, keyed
  reconciliation, and compile-checking every example in the README.

### Fixed

- **`TextField.id()` did not key the node.** It set `_id`, which reached the
  uuid later through the style, but never returned the node's unkeyed slot — so
  a conditionally-rendered field with an id renumbered all of its unkeyed
  siblings. It now behaves exactly like `.id()` on the element builders. The
  shared logic lives on `UINode.refundUnkeyedSlot`.
- **`.id()` and `.src()` could corrupt sibling naming, or panic.** Both refund
  the "unkeyed slot" that automatic naming took for the node, but nothing
  tracked whether the refund had already happened. `.src(...).id(...)`, or two
  `.id()` calls, decremented twice for one slot — renumbering every later
  sibling, and overflowing the `usize` when the count was already zero. A
  `uuid_is_user_set` flag now makes the refund happen exactly once.

- `Animation.RemovalQueue.release` freed memory it did not own — `uuid` is
  borrowed from the `UINode`.
- `HashStyle` hashed `v.animation` by pointer address. It is frame-arena
  allocated, so identical styles hashed differently on every frame.
- Bridge's timeout dispatch pointed at three registries that no longer existed,
  and nine of its wasm exports lacked a calling convention, so they could not be
  exported at all.
- `Configuration.configurePlainByNode` was missing the `.radio` prong that
  `configureByNode` already had.
- `Kit.Window.params` and `Element.selection` fell off the end of non-void
  functions on their non-wasm paths.
